Welcome to lascar's documentation!
==================================

*Lascar* is a fast, versatile, and open-source python3 library designed to
facilitate Side-Channel Analysis. It is intended to be used by seasoned
side-channel attackers as well as laymen who would like to get a feel of
side-channel analysis.

From side-channel acquisitions to results management, passing by signal
synchronisation, custom attacks, *Lascar* provides classes/functions to solve
most of the obstacles an attacker would face, when needed to perform sound,
state-of-the-art side-channel analysis.

This project has been developed in parallel of the activities done by
*Ledger Donjon*, Ledger's security team, to fully match needs regarding
side-channel evaluation.
