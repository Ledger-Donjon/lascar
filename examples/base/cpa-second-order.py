"""
In this script, we show how to perform second-order Correlation Power Analysis with lascar to retrieve an AES keybyte.

Second-order means that the sensitive value is masked.

We first create a ToyAesSecondOrderContainer designed to simulate the leakage of a masked sbox.
Behind that, we show how to use the CenteredProductProcessing to recombine time samples
Finaly, a classical CPA is used to retrieve the key.

To mount a second-order cpa, leakage samples have to be recombinated, using a leakage processiNg: CenteredProductProcessing.
It takes as input the samples to be recombinated: the time sample where the mask is maniulated (5), and the time sample where the masked value is manipulates (10).
It results of a leakage processing which, when appliied to the container, produces leakages with a centered product of time sample 5 with time sample 10.

Instead of singletons, we could have rebombinated multiple points of interests.

For instance, applying CenteredProductProcessing(container, ([4,5], [10,11,12])) would have produced a container with 6 recombinated samples 
(4 with 10, 4 with 11, 4 with 12, 5 with 10, 5 with 11, 5 with 12)

But in this simple case, we know exactly when occurs the relevant events ([5] and [10])
