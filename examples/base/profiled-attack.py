"""
This script demonstrates how to use sklearn classifiers and keras model within lascar to perform profiled SCA.

Profiled SCA means that the attacker has access to an sample of the Device Under Test with known guess.
He can hence learn how the DUT behave, and build a classifier which will after be applied on a device with unknown guess

In this example, QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis is performed on simulated AES traces.
Two steps:

1 - Use ProfileEngine to learn on traces with known guess
2 - Use of MatchEngine to apply the classifier on traces with unknown guess.

This can be used with all classifier provided by sklearn
(see http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.html for a list of classifiers)

And with all keras Neural Network inherating from keras.Model

The ProfileEngine is actually a PartitionerEngine (such as SnrEngine, NicvEngine, TTestEngine...)
Specifically it needs:
- a sklearn Classifier instantiated (such as QuadraticDiscriminantAnalysis) or a keras neural network compiled
- a partition function, which will separate leakages into classes
- a "number_of_partitions" to indicate the number of possible classes for the partition_function


The MatchEngine is actually a GuessEngine (such as CpaHypothesisEngine)
Specifically it needs:
- a classifier which has been already trained (with ProfileEngine)
- a selection function (under guess hypothesis) on the sensitive value (here the output of the sbox at first round)
- a "guess_range" which will define what are the guess possible values
