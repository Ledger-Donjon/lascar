"""
In this script, we demonstrate how to use CpaPartitionedEngine. For more detail, please consult the class documentation.

Here, since we focus only on 8bits of 'value', there is only 256 possible inputs.
The CpaPartitionedEngine takes profits of this property, and computes a Cpa more quickly than a CpaEngine would have done.

During the workflow, a partitioning has to be done, and the leakage model is applied in the end, during the finalize() method.
