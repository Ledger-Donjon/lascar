    CpaPartitionedEngine is an optimization of CpaEngine, that can be used when the cardinal of the domain
    of the selection_function is low.

    In such a case, this engine first partitions the leakages according to a partitioning_function
     on this 'small' domain.
     Then one (or several) leakage_model can be applied on this partitioning.

     When dealing with appropriate data (enought number of traces, partition appropriated),
     the complexity of this engine is much lower than a classical CpaEngine, since the model is computed once one each
     partition_range values, instead of on all the traces values.
